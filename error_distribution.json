year ago and plans fell through And so expectations were highmaybe too high I had made reservations a month prior since we had cousins coming into town joining us for dinner a concert later We arrived and the place was not that busy for a Sunday evening But right after us people started coming in and it filled up We enjoyed reviewing the menu selections and ended up ordering quite a feast which included 2 charcuterie boards and another 6 tapas Initially the waitress was a little pushy trying to get us to place an order and hovering nothing like feeling pressure and when I finally ordered the wine for the table she seemed slightly taken aback that I ordered the wine instead of the menfolk I worked in the biz 20yrs ago and I know wine so really who cares who orders Our cousin the other lady in the group ordered a flight of wine tasters and was waiting for the charcuterie to arrive so she could enjoy some of the cheese with her wine 45 minutes later we finally had to enquire as to where are meal was since we had a concert to go to in an hour What we were told was there was a large group in the house and only 2 in the kitchen What we heard was we didnt properly staff our restaurant for this evening and so all the customers food will take a long time Seriously a charcuterie board taking 60 minutes 10 minutes later it finally arrived It was certainly delicious but the wine flight had long been consumed by this time 5 minutes later the tapas started arriving and of course we were running late so everything was eaten hastily and we cant help but wonder prepared this way also The BC Seared Scallops were gritty although the broth was tasty The Eggplant Chips were missing the eggplant and all you could taste was the crispy coating The Falafels were doughy inside The Flight Bite with Lamb Stew was good The Artic Char was goodthe Lobster Nachos had a nice flavour but seemed to be missing lobster 3 pieces is all we could find Finally the Flank steak arrived and made hubs happy Cooked to perfection Even more delightful were the accompanying cooked winter greens Holy deliciousnesseveryone agreed and we chowed down on those delectable greens like hungry little rabbits During our meal we asked for the wine menu again since the cousin with the empty wine flight had not been asked if she wanted anything further to drink For a waitress who was hovering at the beginning we had to battle to get and keep her attention now Our cousin was drinking white and asking for suggestions She was given a recommendation by the waitress who then turned to leave without addressing any of the rest of us We called her backsince we also wanted to order more wine Wow does body language speak volumes and we felt like we were imposing on our waitress I ordered 2 more wine tasters for hubs myself Then the waitress turned to run away again not even addressing the white wine drinker who was also ready to order We called her back YET again and uneasily felt like we were still bothering her Since we were already late for the concert we had no time for dessert or an after dinner beverage We spent a lot of money for a mediocre evening and left slightly disappointed by the overall experience The cousins advised they enjoyed the company and some of the foodwine but this would not be there first choice again As for us I am hoping it was just bad planning and a bad night for the

went with the recommendation from another review of the queso with everything except chorizo for an app and 2 tacos rojas which were all vegetarian Another disappointment when both arrived at the same

and jumpy people go for the lines They have actors with chainsaws and creepy makeup pacing around scaring the easy targets posing for pictures and giving you a preview of whats to come The actual haunted house is nothing special If youve been to one before youll see it all again You have actors in creepy makeup and clothing jumping out at you slamming things against the wall or floor and

then pop up next to you The first time or two I saw this it was downright hilarious this does not seem to be an easy or very practiced thing for the actors to do and some of them ate it or slammed

he essentially said your AC unit is causing your tenants monthly power bill to increase The cost of replacing it would be less than the cost of repairing it You need a new AC I replied and asked how much more the bill is than it should be and how is it even possible to measure that I also asked why if I need a new AC was I not informed of this back in March after the inspection No response I sent

hand Food Complimentary bread and pretzels The pretzels were in the shape of a breadstick but they were perfectly chewy and soft They serve the pretzel with a mustard cheese sauce and regular butter Id recommend going with the cheese sauce The other bread that they served seemed to be some type of wheat bread with toasted seeds on top Definitely not as good as the pretzels Braised beef cheek Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe This dish was very disappointing The beef cheek itself didnt taste fresh Think of when a fatty beef dish gets cold You get that layer of oily white fat It tasted and felt like that in my mouth which is not appetizing at all Also the gravy was pretty bland Not worth the 28 25 Pan seared diver scallops Braised artichokes baby carrots pearl onions in a white wine garlic broth They give 4 scallops in this dish Its not very filling at all since they dont give any type of carb with this dish It could definitely use some risotto mashed potatoes pasta or

we will be needed refills soon She then walks away After awhile we were ready to order more drinks She never came up to us I had to flag her down Thought the day she paid attention to EVERYONE around

arriving along with all servers They all seemed to have migrated to a different portion of the restaurant The other issue I had with the evening was that all the meat except the steak was very dry and over cooked As our reservation was at 6pm I cant imagine this was because the meat had cooked too long during service It was a Thursday evening with Im sure slower traffic than a weekend but I would have thought the kitchen would be aware of how many reservations and on average how much of which dishes move during an evening and would adjust accordingly Sadly to say that does not seem to be the

the appt for that day in which the stylist had an appt avaliable When I arrived a few minutes before my appt I was bothered by someone elses child that was getting their hair done which in most salons children are not allowed unless being serviced so that was an instant draw back considering when most people are getting serviced in a salon they would like a serene environment Anyways as time went

continued to wait and it ended up being an hour and half by the time I was seated unacceptable when you have an appt scheduled by that time it ended up being even longer because someone that walked in

weekly So I decided to just somehow get my moneys worth and schedule another appt to redo my lashes At time of appt I was still charged a 40 difference for the volume set When volume is what should have been done the first time around and whichever set was put on initially didnt even last a few days For all the inconvenience as is you would think they would have just waived the 40 difference I didnt want to hassle and just happily paid the difference Only hoping that this time around it would be done correctly I was fortunate enough to be booked with Kayu who was very sweet and listened to my concerns and what I wanted as far as length prior to beginningThe result came out definitely a whole lot better than the first time but was still a bit all over the place David Kayu and staff are

it would be 59 However the service advisor came back later and said it would be 99 for a full diagnostic test Troubleshooting the problem After a couple hours they called me to the desk and said i would need the following Starter Battery Fuel Pump Fuel Filter Vacuum Line I thought to my self theres no way all those auto parts went bad at the same time on my car They gave me a price of 229 for the battery I told them I can buy it at Advance Auto Parts for 169 So I bought it at Advance and brought it back and put it in myself However I had someone else to check battery and they said all it needed was a slow charge The mechanic said that my starter was fried which the manager agreed was not very professional words used by the mechanic I didnt believe anything was wrong with my starter So I told them to just put the fuel pump fuel filter and vacuum line on and we will see if it will start up afterwards For these 3 parts and labor they gave a price of over 1204 My investigation I called up a neighbor Firestone in Fort Mill and the woman gave a me price of 58487 for the fuel pump fuel filter and labor Why is the price so far apart in difference I questioned the manager about the call I made to Fort Mill Firestone and told him the woman gave me a price of 58487 He said cant be I repeated myself and said I just called them and thats the price she gave me Again he says cant be while shaking his head I felt like he just called me a liar I also called up some other repair shops and they were a lot cheaper too Most prices were in the upper 550 to 590 range including a Firestone in Cleveland Mississippi Another price difference I called up Advance Auto Parts and they gave me a price of 269 for the fuel pump which has the fuel filter with it included Yet this Firestone want to charge me about 450 just for that fuel pump This is not a parts house They buy their parts from places like Advance Autozone and etc then add a markup to that price Final Thoughts Yes I know I helped

was not I was disappointed but I didnt let that ruin my experience The service was fantastic the best I ever had Both waiters were attentive and very knowledgeable The reason why I am giving this 2 stars regardless of the poor food quality is the following as my friend and I reviewed our 528 bill for the evening I noticed a random 2 charge listed as a Sauce I did ask the server to bring me a side of the House sauce but didnt expect he would charge me for it Not a big deal I can afford 2 its the principle that counts When I asked him about it and told him that I think it was kind of ridiculous that I am being charged an extra 2 for the house steak sauce the comment was thats absolutely right 2 for the sauce With that said I graciously paid my bill thanked my server for the

of which they had ONE in the whole store Luckily I came to see just that one I had already looked at it online I show up begin to head inside and am met by a salesperson Sean from Michigan who promptly runs to meet me before I enter the showroom Immediately I inform him of which vehicle I came to look at and he quickly obliges by bringing a golf cart to the front for us to drive to the vehicle We get to the Trailhawk and the sticker price is priced about 2k higher than online I inform Sean of this and he takes a minute to look at the website confirms what I said and lets me know that they would honor the online price The sticker price contradicting the online price was a little off putting What if I hadnt checked online first So we get in the Jeep Sean drives it to the gas station to fill up and lets me know that I am fine to go ahead and get into the drivers seat I move over to the drivers seat Meanwhile he is paying for the gas and as Im sitting there Im looking around checking everything out The first noticeable mishap was a scratch on the interior door I mention it to him and he brushes it off as just residue that will wash off Umm no it was clearly NOT just residue nevermind that I already saw him scratch the tint with the seatbelt buckle As Im looking around more I cant help but think that this 2018 vehicle with 4 miles on it literally looks like it has been used It was dirty and there was trash in the door I guess from a previous test drive It just wasnt presentable at all Sean made sure to mention that it had been on the lot for about a month and that usually cars dont stay on the lot that long Okay sooo why is THIS one still there Then comes the nitty gritty part of car buying the money and the numbers BEFORE I even indicate whether or not I actually want to proceed with the purchase Sean insists that I hurry and fill out the credit application I promptly put things on hold informing him that we needed to talk a liiiittle bit more about the exact details before we go any further After honoring the online price and offering 5k for my trade in I let him know that the offer on the trade in just wont work at all Good thing I did ample research before coming in because I was well aware that EVEN as a trade in my vehicle was worth at least 7k So after a bit of back and forth and him leaving to ask the manager we settle on 6500 Next was time to talk about financing and down payment Luckily they didnt really give me any hassle on wanting to go through my own third party broker for financing but once we started talking about down payment the conversation took a pretty crazy turn I insisted that I wanted to put a down payment to lower the financed amount I let Sean know that I wanted to pay in cash not check of which I would have to go and get He informs me that he doesnt think they can take cash as a down payment So funny because the dealership I ended up buying from let me pay using my debit card same as cash So we went from first putting a down payment to we dont take cash can you write a check to how about you dont put a down payment AT ALL to okay we CAN take cash to why do you have to go and GET the cash cant your boyfriend just bring it to you At this point I realize that this is all going way wrong For one I am in not so many words somewhat being held hostage they have the keys to my trade in of which I had to ask for when I began heading towards the exit Im asked not to leave to get my down payment THEN Sean begins grasping at straws to get me to proceed with filling out the credit app I oblige just to get him to stop hassling me Deciding that Im really not into this particular Trailhawk I ask if theres any way they can keep an eye out on a white one for me instead Sean tells me they CANT keep an eye out for a white one and continues trying everything in his power to get me not to leave even after we discussed that I wanted to go get cash I finally am allowed to leave but only if I promise to be back in 45 minutes nevermind the place I need to go is across town It was about 5pm and he wanted an exact time of how long it would take for me to get the money It was very awkward He informs me that while Im gone theyll go ahead and run my app and I beg them to hold off until I get back Obviously at this point Im NOT coming back Had Sean not been so pushy and not forthcoming regarding the fact that they COULD have looked out for a white Trailhawk for me he later back peddled over text and told me they could make it happen I may have proceeded with my purchase here But I

avoid the ends of the arena unless you really want to cheer for a certain country in that area Over all the show was pretty cool I didnt understand when booking dragon doesnt do any of the competing in the games and is more of the antagonist That means youre sitting in the bulk of the show with no one to cheer on even in the start As an adult that is ok I took a while to figure out we didnt have a king at all Im not sure how ideal that section is for the kids You do get to cheer for the villain that has pyrotechnics whos pretty awesome a bit later on though so maybe that has extra draw to the kids I like the show Its light hearted and fun with some extra pizzazz Its interactive and you can be a bit silly Its not my favorite show but its pretty good Likely the best family show Ive seen in

discernable enough to stand out as a flavor unto itself And the ganache was more like dry chocolaty icing IMO not really worth the calories 2 The caramel is a butter cake think yellow filled with caramel mouse and topped with a light caramel frosting The cake was a pretty standard yellow cake The filling was again so mild in flavor that there really wasnt much point in its being there The frosting described as mildly flavored was more of an understatement I really think it was white frosting with a light glazing of caramel underneath IMO really not worth the calories or the price 3The carrot is filled with cream cheese mouse and topped with cream cheese frosting At least this one resembled its description but I wasnt blown away 4 The lemon is a lemon cake filled with lemon chiffon and topped with lemon frosting This was the closest thing to decent in the half dozen that I took home I couldnt detect any lemon in the cake but the filling almost had a hint of tartness and the frosting actually had some zest mixed in which is what I would expect I will definitely support Sweet Thang as a downtown addition but will probably stick to their lunches The search for the ultimate

that was walking around said nothing to this group Finally when I could no longer hear what Ayesha was saying I got up and told the Junior Aristocrats to shut the hell up The manager and the waiter came over to apologize for the patrons behavior I wish they would have done the scolding not me oh well I could finally enjoy my meal I got the Marguerite which was cut into strips rather than triangles The pizza sauce was flavorful and the cheese was real mozzarella not that processed stuff that you would find on cheaper pizza The wine that I picked was really good though I cant remember what I drank sorry gang I really liked the decor and the 007 movies playing in the background I look forward to visiting Cheuvronts again to try their other dishes and maybe not have to set some

is situated inside a wine store Be very careful if you are planning to bring your kids here This is not a kid friendly store One of our friends brought there kid here on another visit and broke something in store The store owner forced them to pay for the item so be warned We started out with a cheese plate which came with grapes jam nuts etc and also bread This was quite tasty The main entree was quite expensive I dont even remember the name of the fish but it was nice and flaky and fresh Not quite up to the 28 dollar price quality that you would expect ordering the fish at

order even after I was clearly done with the menu The wait for the food wasnt terrible When my wine was about 23 empty the woman who took my order asked if I wanted another glass When I asked her how much longer the food would take She said it would be a while So I ordered another The food came out maybe 5 or 6 minutes later I dont have a problem with waiting for my food if theres a reason But

very dry I asked for brown rice and got white and that the sauce to food ratio was severely lacking If I order a curry I obviously dont want soup which this most certainly was not but Id like to have enough sauce that I can taste a bit in each bite Generally the lack of curry sauce made the whole dish feel dry and a bit boing Still the sauce itself was awesome and the vegetables were cooked

dont have to watch ppl walking up and down right next to your food But after we were sitted no one ever came by or gave us water or anything while the tables next to us got water refilled at least twice no one came serve us and we literally just sat there for 15 mins with thirsty mouth Finally I have to grab a waitress that was walking by and ask her at least get us a cup of water I think we just got missed while switching tables and they dont know who should be serving us and we finally got our waitress whom is super amazing and has a lot of good reccomendation The food portion is super small more like tapa even though they priced at entree price We ended up ordering a lot Food is good but the portion dont really worth the price you paid if you come with empty stomach then you better be ready to starve or have a strong heart to see the final bill lol Two of us orderred pretty much all the popular items on the menu fried seafood squid ink suckling pig fries fish dish and also drinksand we are not ppl with big appetite We ordered the pervian chocolate as appetizer and this is the best thing of the night that actually worth every penny you paid So yummy and i highly recommend it I was totally blown by the first bite And i was glad that we didnt order the chocolate ball the table next to us ordered it but i guess its only good for picture they didnt seem too impressesd as there were a lot left Okie down to the best part is our bills this dinner cost almost 200 for two ppl Well i was ready for it when I kept asking for the menu becuase the portion is just

IN LINE facing away from the takeout counter lol After we got seated it took us another 20 minutes to get our fries and drinks so The food was not bad I personally love the sweet potato fries but everything else is just alright I only recommend eating here if you just want to chill with some friends I probably wont be coming here again it was good while it lasted but Service has been going

that was weird for me The alcohol or if they do in the sauce on top was strong I was thinking man getting drunk on cinnamon roll The portion size is huge Neither one of us were able to finish our

while for over 10 years With some menu items there is no space for error like congee or anything deep fried Consistent and simple The complex dishes such as chow mein will come with different recipesingredients depending on todays cook The service is a whole different story Its clear that the waiters are overworked and find little happiness or meaningfulness in their job because they are stern and interact as minimally as possible with guests Almost as if they have so many horror stories between difficult customers which Im sure is all too often considering they get the night owls with postpartying munchies that they do not care for the impression they leave on guests Servers I recognize have worked here for years always appear pissed off On one occasion I waited over 45 minutes between 2 dishes in a single order It was thrown onto my table with bad attitude because I checked up on its status with the servers twice I didnt leave a tip when paying Without thanks and after counting the money in front of us the server raised her voice saying NO TIP Yes no tip I dont tip shit service Another day I came in at 6AM There were 2 other guests in the restaurant All was fine and well until I caught sight of a staff picking up GARBAGE including dirty tissue and bones off the floor with KITCHEN TONGS And no they were not marked tongs for garbage there must have been tons of the same kind used for food And then we flipped the lid of our tea pot to request more tea and there was what looked like dark crusted slimy tea leaves or mold on the underside of the lid

never tried called Passage to India It looked busy and in fact when we were told we could wait a while or be seated on the patio we never even imagined that we would be waited on so quickly We ordered pretty quickly once seated and noticed at the time we were the third couple seated on the patio three more tables were seated during the time that we ate some cracker bread with a very nice mint sauce We started at 730pm roughly We then noticed that after the first of the three earliest tables was served apologetically for the lateness and it was very late when they got theirs that the two freshest seated tables then got served and then the server who frankly had the table manner of a truckstop waitress with her jokes and comments and style of talking about the place she was working apologized for the amount of rice but that they had gotten the last of it By that I assumed she meant that the serving in the pot was shy of a full serving of rice but then the manager came out about an hour into our wait so it was around 830pm and apologized for the lateness and the few minutes delay in the order printing The couple that was there before us that had not been served were also told as were we that our meal would be half priced By almost 9pm we still had only had two baskets of cracker bread and a couple of drink refills Dr Pepper and Indian Chai for my wife When food finally came out for the couple that had been seated before us they were told there is no more rice sorry but we did not expect to get slammed like this Meanwhile of course both my wife and I realized that our dishes would also be best served with Rice and an hour and a half into our experience that was not going to be the case Any longer and we were going to be late for our 930 movie so we left a 5 on the table and left While we watched through the window there were several tables that had been seated after us inside that were already eating so while several of us had a horrible experience that night it is no doubt also true that many people had a flawless night at the same restaurant I guess timing is everything and I really am not sure if I ever want to give them a second shot but might try calling the manager this morning although he was the same guy that said he would half price our meal because of the slight delay on the orders Umm an hour and a half is not a slight delay when people that

looked like he was going to fall andor drop the dresser completely He rested the dresser on a stair while they tried to get it up the stairwell These rests caused several punctures in the back of the dresser because it was banging into the top of the landing banister each time At the end of the move I sat down with the guy who was in charge and gave him the necessary information for the damage claim After this was done another guy started to fill out the rest of the paperwork and add up the time and cost for the job This took several minutes and he did all of the calculations without a calculator and had to review the numbers several times He then told us we were being charged for an additional 15 minutes because the move was estimated for 3 hours 930am 1230pm and he did not finish the paperwork until 1232pm After the paperwork was done they returned to the truck and I walked upstairs to further inspect my dresser and saw that the boxspring that was supposed to be on the bed was in the wrong room and the other boxspring was resting against a dresser and the mattress resting against the wall I moved the boxspring into the correct room and placed the mattress on the boxspring

area where vehicle stereos GPS and Radar Detectors were The was no sales associate anywhere to be found I spotted a Blue Shirt walking briskly like PacMan in and out of the aisles My fiance gave chase and finally hunted him down She asked for assistance and he quickly got on his CIA approved ear bud and called someone to assist us Ok cool we got someone on the way Still waiting for another 10 minutes I sought out the small kid again in the Blue Shirt and not knowing I was with my fiance he seemed eager to help me I told him what I needed and he then realized I was with her and knew that I was just getting fed up So again he called for someone on his ear bud not sure why he just could not help us So instead a kid from the camera section comes over who barely knew anything about the remote start let alone anything in the automotive area We had many questions to ask and at first he seemed to take them on decently but then it was getting out of his realm He called for an installer and slowly slipped away as someone was chatting in his ear bud about a camera question This whole process was approximately 35 minutes now I think we waited another 2 mintues and walked out of the store That is the first time I have walked out of a Best Buy disappointed I really dont know if I would go back there I know I wont for anything auto related The sad thing is we called Auto Sound in Willoughby and were given all the answers to the questions we had over the phone and bought and installed the remote start that same day Best Buy had us waiting a week All in all I think the Automotive area of Best Buy is lacking and I dont think their associates in the store know too much about that stuff It is the installers who can really help but they are busy in the garage They need

to explain that I wasnt comfortable with medication increases or additions he would simply say that we should stop seeing each other as we might not be a good fit for one another This to me was

see repeatedly that USA Today included 13th Floor in their list of Top 13 Haunted Houses in America The Arizona incarnation leaves something to be desired Located in a rentedout strip mall in a seedy part of Bell Avenue 13th Floor does not impress you from the getgo What you do notice right away is the crowd of hundreds of people lined up to get inside and get spooked I took this as a good sign

person and you want some time to build up the anticipation and adrenaline by being surrounded by a ton of giddy and jumpy people go for the lines They have actors with chainsaws and creepy makeup pacing around scaring the easy targets posing for pictures and giving you a preview of whats to come The actual haunted house is nothing special If youve been to one before youll see it all again You have actors in creepy makeup and clothing jumping out at you slamming things against the wall or floor and getting up in your face There are rooms youre led through themed as grisly defiled homes kitchens and hallways there was a piratethemed area and a misty jungle to walk through I was disappointed in the lack of jumps in that area the scare potential among the closepressing fog bushes and trees was great I wish I had been able to go through more slowly to admire the props and background setup everything was something youve seen before but it was beautifully set up 13th Floor may not have scared me but they get points for attention to detail One thing that Ill admit Ive never seen before was the usage of partially closed garage doors placed in strategic areas Open only a foot or two from the floor an actor would get a running start and slide on his knees out from under the door and then pop up next to you The first time or two I saw this it was downright hilarious this does not seem to be an easy or very practiced thing for the actors to do and some of them ate it or slammed into my legs like they were trying to take me out The actors are not supposed toallowed to touch you I will admit that Im not an easy person to scare Im not jumpy or unnerved by the dark loud sounds or people lunging at my face suddenly When you take care of a toddler all day you develop a sort of Clint Eastwood hardness and eventually lose your flinching reflex There were however people all around me screaming their heads off in terror One girl was even sobbing If that isnt a testament to 13th Floors fear factor I dont know what is The fatal flaw of my visit was the fact that the event staff was not separating the groups for long enough time periods Things cease to be scary when youre basically part of a continuous shuffling line of people Youre rushed and you can see ahead of you whats about to pop out of that dark corner because you just watched the group ahead of you deal with it Our total time going through the house was 13 minutes Yes I timed it We paid 35 per person to get a VIP ticket which gives you access to a much shorter line regular admission is 25 Had I paid half

waiter took at least 10 minutes just to come and take our order It took an additional 35 minutes just to get our food I understand the place is pretty busy but they should already know the place will be packed on a Saturday night and have the correct amount of staff on hand Food Complimentary bread and pretzels The pretzels were in the shape of a breadstick but they were perfectly chewy and soft They serve the pretzel with a mustard cheese sauce and regular butter Id recommend going with the cheese sauce The other bread that they served seemed to be some type of wheat bread with toasted seeds on top Definitely not as good as the pretzels Braised beef cheek Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe This dish was very disappointing The beef cheek itself didnt taste fresh Think of when a fatty beef dish gets cold You get that layer of oily white fat It tasted and felt like that in my mouth which is not appetizing at all Also the gravy was pretty bland Not worth the 28 25 Pan seared diver scallops Braised artichokes baby carrots pearl onions in a white wine garlic broth They give 4 scallops in this dish Its not very filling at all since they dont give any type of carb with this

minutes to get our drinks and a small complimentary basket of chips Did I mention that the basket of chip was small Our party of four devoured them in three minutes but no one came by to ask us if we wanted more It should be noted that the first basket of chips was free after that youll be charged 2 for a bottomless supply The chips were the star of the evening Hot fresh with plenty of crunch I would make the trip to the west side just to get another fix The consistency of the salsa verde was a disappointment It was far too watery making it difficult to get the right balance of salsa and chip I also enjoyed the Quesadillas de Rajas y Queso we ordered as an appetizer The corn masa coating was cooked to perfection but I would have preferred a Mexican cheese over the mozzarella used as the filling The roasted poblanos were excellent and a small serving of crema was a welcome addition to the dish After a long wait about 20 minutes and only one refill of our basket of chips we received the entrees I ordered one of the specials a beef barbacoa based on the recommendation of the server The beef was tender but a little under seasoned The dish was overpowered by a pile of raw onions that topped the beef I like onions but these gave the dish a sulphery aftertaste The sides also were disappointing the refried beans were overcooked and lacked texture the Mexican rice was mushy and bland With the little more focus on the details this could have been a great meal The kids ordered cheese enchiladas and chicken enchiladas The salsa verde lacked punch The tomatillos really needed to be roasted longer to give the green sauce more depth The chicken was well cooked but under seasoned and I was frustrated with the the use of mozzarella as the filling for the cheese enchiladas There are some great Mexican melting cheeses that could have vastly improved this dish After another long wait we finally received the bill which totaled 65 before tip for our group of four

ignoring us We finally managed to flag one down by literally yelling We didnt know what else to do since wed been waiting at least ten minutes for somebody to serve us and we were hungry We finally got some meat and it was fine but then the same thing happened on the next course For the next hour we played this game where the waiters would walk by us doing their best to avoid eye contact and wed try to intercept them Its very hard to avoid concluding that they are really not that keen on giving you meat here which kind of negates the point of being a churrascaria The three sides were all

weekly So I decided to just somehow get my moneys worth and schedule another appt to redo my lashes At time of appt I was still charged a 40 difference for the volume set When volume is what should have been done the first time around and whichever set was put on initially didnt even last a few days For all the inconvenience as is you would think they would have just waived the 40 difference I didnt want to hassle and just happily paid the difference Only hoping that this time around it would be done correctly I was fortunate enough to be booked with Kayu who was very sweet and listened to my concerns and what I wanted as far as length prior to beginningThe result came out definitely a whole lot better than the first time but was still a bit all over the place David Kayu and staff are

this place They stated they would have to do diagnostic test and said it would be 59 However the service advisor came back later and said it would be 99 for a full diagnostic test Troubleshooting the problem After a couple hours they called me to the desk and said i would need the following Starter Battery Fuel Pump Fuel Filter Vacuum Line I thought to my self theres no way all those auto parts went bad at the same time on my car They gave me a price of 229 for the battery I told them I can buy it at Advance Auto Parts for 169 So I bought it at Advance and brought it back and put it in myself However I had someone else to check battery and they said all it needed was a slow charge The mechanic said that my starter was fried which the manager agreed was not very professional words used by the mechanic I didnt believe anything was wrong with my starter So I told them to just put the fuel pump fuel filter and vacuum line on and we will see if it will start up afterwards For these 3 parts and labor they gave a price of over 1204 My investigation I called up a neighbor Firestone in Fort Mill and the woman gave a me price of 58487 for the fuel pump fuel filter and labor Why is the price so far apart in difference I questioned the manager about the call I made to Fort Mill Firestone and told him the woman gave me a price of 58487 He said cant be I repeated myself and said I just called them and thats the price she gave me Again he says cant be while shaking his head I felt like he just called me a liar I also called up some other repair shops and they were a lot cheaper too Most prices were in the upper 550 to 590 range including a Firestone in Cleveland Mississippi Another price difference I called up Advance Auto Parts and they gave me a price of 269 for the fuel

salesperson Sean from Michigan who promptly runs to meet me before I enter the showroom Immediately I inform him of which vehicle I came to look at and he quickly obliges by bringing a golf cart to the front for us to drive to the vehicle We get to the Trailhawk and the sticker price is priced about 2k higher than online I inform Sean of this and he takes a minute to look at the website confirms what I said and lets me know that they would honor the online price The sticker price contradicting the online price was a little off putting What if I hadnt checked online first So we get in the Jeep Sean drives it to the gas station to fill up and lets me know that I am fine to go ahead and get into the drivers seat I move over to the drivers seat Meanwhile he is paying for the gas and as Im sitting there Im looking around checking everything out The first noticeable mishap was a scratch on the interior door I mention it to him and he brushes it off as just residue that will wash off Umm no it was clearly NOT just residue nevermind that I already saw him scratch the tint with the seatbelt buckle As Im looking around more I cant help but think that this 2018 vehicle with 4 miles on it literally looks like it has been used It was dirty and there was trash in the door I guess from a previous test drive It just wasnt presentable at all Sean made sure to mention that it had been on the lot for about a month and that usually cars dont stay on the lot that long Okay sooo why is THIS one still there Then comes the nitty gritty part of car buying the money and the numbers BEFORE I even indicate whether or not I actually want to proceed with the purchase Sean insists that I hurry and fill out the credit application I promptly put things on hold informing him that we needed to talk a liiiittle bit more about the exact details before we go any further After honoring the online price and offering 5k for my trade in I let him know that the offer on the trade in just wont work at all Good thing I did ample research before coming in because I was well aware that EVEN as a trade in my vehicle was worth at least 7k So after a bit of back and forth and him leaving to ask the manager we settle on 6500 Next was time to talk about financing and down payment Luckily they didnt really give me any hassle on wanting to go through my own third party broker for financing but once we started talking about down payment the conversation took a pretty crazy turn I insisted that I wanted to put a down payment to lower the financed amount I let Sean know that I wanted to pay in cash not check of which I would have to go and get He informs me that he doesnt think they can take cash as a down payment So funny because the dealership I ended up buying from let me pay using my debit card same as cash So we went from first putting a down payment to we dont take cash can you write a check to how about you dont put a down payment AT ALL to okay we CAN take cash to why do you have to go and GET the cash cant your boyfriend just bring it to you At this point I realize that this is all going way wrong For one I am in not so many words somewhat being held hostage they have the keys to my trade in of which I had to ask for when I began heading towards the exit Im asked not to leave to get my down payment THEN Sean begins grasping at straws to get me to proceed with filling out the credit app I oblige just to get him to stop hassling me Deciding that Im really not into this particular Trailhawk I ask if theres any way they can keep an eye out on a white one for me instead Sean tells me they CANT keep an eye out for a white one and continues trying everything in his power to get me not to leave even after we discussed that I wanted to go get cash I finally am allowed to leave but only if I promise to be back in 45 minutes nevermind the place I need to go is across town It was about 5pm and he wanted an exact time of how long it would take for me to get the money It was very awkward He informs me that while Im gone theyll go ahead and run my app and I beg them to hold off until I get back Obviously at this point Im NOT coming back Had Sean not been so pushy and not forthcoming regarding the fact that they COULD have looked out for a white Trailhawk for me he later back peddled over text and told me they could make it happen I may have proceeded with my

really varied as sometimes they folded the towels well and sometimes they didnt Sometimes the beds were made well and sometimes not The shower had mediocre water pressure and the elevators had 1 shaft in each tower that made me edgy to get into I actually ended up in 1 in each area visiting friends that proved this theory true but the one in my section would have all of the buttons just turn off if pressed in an odd sequence so people kept missing their floors Very frustrating The buffet is mediocre giving some variety but not really impressing me I also have issues with a place that doesnt have at least 10 tables but maybe Im just cheap Those were the reasons it isnt a 5 star hotel Here are the pros The casino has really clean bathrooms The selection of restaurants and celebrity chefs is staggering The Joel Robuchon restaurants are my favorite places anywhere so that has to elevate it to begin with The Cirque du Soleil show KA is stunning I highly recommend it Studio 54 is only soso

Thang Cute space friendly staff nice selection of teas and the fact that they have a five minute lunch menu sets them apart But the cupcakes do not I will say that these were better cupcakes in comparison to some of their peers however I am still baffled at how this has become the holy grail of sweet treats The one constant between the four flavors that I sampled were that they were at least sort of moist But flavorful meh not so much I tried the chocolate carrot lemon and caramel So here is the breakdown on the little cakes 1 The chocolate is duh chocolate cake with a chocolateraspberry mouse filling and topped with ganache The cake was dark like chocolate but pretty dull in flavor The filling was there but not discernable enough to stand out as a flavor unto itself And the ganache was more like dry chocolaty icing IMO not really worth the calories 2 The caramel is a butter cake think yellow filled with caramel mouse and topped with a light caramel frosting The cake was a pretty standard yellow cake The filling was again so mild in flavor that there really wasnt much point in its being there The frosting described as mildly flavored was more of an understatement I really think it was white frosting with a light glazing of caramel underneath IMO really not worth the calories or the price 3The carrot is filled with cream cheese mouse and topped with cream cheese frosting At least this one resembled its description but I wasnt blown away 4 The lemon is a lemon cake filled with lemon chiffon and topped with lemon frosting This was the closest thing to decent in the half dozen that I took home I couldnt detect any lemon in the cake but the filling almost had a hint of tartness and the frosting actually had some zest mixed in which is what I would expect I

doors placed in strategic areas Open only a foot or two from the floor an actor would get a running start and slide on his knees out from under the door and then pop up next to you The first time or two I saw this it was downright hilarious this does not seem to be an easy or very practiced thing for the actors to do and some of them ate it or slammed into my legs like they were trying to take me

migrated to a different portion of the restaurant The other issue I had with the evening was that all the meat except the steak was very dry and over cooked As our reservation was at 6pm I cant

many reservations and on average how much of which dishes move during an evening and would adjust accordingly Sadly to say that does not seem to be the case as chicken pork and even sausage were all

ok I took a while to figure out we didnt have a king at all Im not sure how ideal that section is for the kids You do get to cheer for the villain that has pyrotechnics whos pretty awesome a bit later

flavor The filling was there but not discernable enough to stand out as a flavor unto itself And the ganache was more like dry chocolaty icing IMO not really worth the calories 2 The caramel is a butter cake think yellow filled with caramel mouse and topped with a light caramel frosting The cake was a pretty standard yellow cake The filling was again so mild in flavor that there really wasnt much point in its being there The frosting described as mildly flavored was more of an understatement I really think it was white frosting with a light glazing of caramel underneath IMO really not worth the calories or the price 3The carrot is filled with cream cheese mouse and topped with cream cheese frosting At least this one resembled its description but I wasnt blown away 4 The lemon is a lemon cake filled with lemon chiffon and topped with lemon frosting This was the closest thing to decent in the half dozen that I took home I couldnt detect any lemon in the cake but the filling almost had a hint of tartness and the frosting actually had some zest mixed in which is what I would expect I will definitely support Sweet Thang as a downtown addition but will probably stick to

cashing out so I understand that everyone might have been busybut a hello would have been nice The men at the bar left and I was 1 of 2 people sitting at the bar And I waited some more Anyway after a little over ten minutes I flagged a woman behind the bar to ask for a menu and was finally acknowledged My glass of wine came out fairly quickly but it took her a long time to ask if I was ready to order even after I was clearly done with the menu The wait for the food wasnt terrible When my wine was about 23 empty the woman who took my order asked if I wanted another glass When I asked her how much longer the food would take She said it would be a while So I ordered another The food came out maybe 5 or 6 minutes later I dont have a problem with waiting for my food if theres a reason But please dont knowingly tell me itll be a while just to sell me another glass of wine Anyway onto the most important part of the night the food I got sushi for my fianc\u00e9 which he ate liked but didnt rave about Ive had the pad thai from here before which Ive always enjoyed and I wanted something new so I tried the Roasted Duck Curry Pretty fantastic My only complaints are that the duck was very dry I asked for brown rice and got white and that the sauce to food ratio was severely lacking If I order a curry I obviously dont want soup which this most certainly was not but Id like to have enough sauce that I can taste a bit in each bite Generally the lack of curry sauce made the whole dish feel dry and a bit boing Still the sauce itself was awesome and the vegetables were cooked perfectly Overall Im on the fence Ive been a waitress for long enough that the lack of decent service can make me never want to return to a restaurant Is a few tablespoons of great curry sauce worth a

breakfast by adding yoghurt and fruit from the buffet As a parent I wanted them to have a more balanced breakfast No big deal Ill eat less and they can have my share Its a buffet Thats when one of the

that was weird for me The alcohol or if they do in the sauce on top was strong I was thinking man getting drunk on cinnamon roll The portion size is huge Neither one of us were able to finish our cinnamon roll I would almost say sharing is good idea if not super hungry They also offer gluten free ones It small place not many seats I am fan of the checkerboard old school dinner vibe get from the inside You place order and then pick it up at the end of the counter It open area so can watch your masterpiece come together All the cinnamon rolls served in basket lines with checkerboard paper The floor has that same look Not sure if recall seeing fountain machine They have refrigerator up front with lot of different options comes to bottle drinks from healthy ones coconut water smart water and more They do have a widescreen in one corner of the restaurant It might be little hard to find in the shopping center cause right in the middle It located right across from Chuck E Cheese in the

food and my friend accidently bumped in two a table on his way to the bathroom We all ordered food without alcoholic beverages and the server said that management told him my friend had to leave because he was too intoxicated I understand an establishment not wanting to sere alcohol to someone intoxicated but no one ordered anything alcoholic to drink I asked to talk to the manger which took at least 20 min he then explained to me that my friend could not stay due to it being a Friday night and its way to busy to deal with this kind of inconvenience If it was a Monday or Tuesday no big

gooey The tempura was bland and the sauce was completely flavorless They claim to offer huge discounts on their sushi but thats because they jack up the price and then cross it out on the menu as if

anything is better than nothing Then the third employee at checkout calls us up to pay We pay the bill and when we get the receipt we notice that no discount was applied We asked the employee why we didnt receive a discount from the warranty and he said it was a small discount so he didnt think that we would want it What the heck Why would we not want to save money So we ask him how small the discount is and he admits that he didnt even calculate it So we ask him to fix it and he says that he cant he needs a manager but doesnt know where one is So we finally get a manager there The manager fixed it but I could tell that it was a real hassle because they had made such a huge mistake We ended up saving 40 which was almost half the price of the battery The whole ordeal lasted about 15 hours Save yourself the trouble and go a few blocks down the street to AutoZone The customer service there is incredible They were actually the ones who informed us that it would be a better deal at

it was so busy that evening Maybe a week later I went back to try the Chicken Wing Sliders unfortunately they got my order wrong again but this time I was in a rush and just ate the sliders They were good not great The main issue I have with them is that they have a wonderbread type bun Just empty whitebread carbs that basically taste like nothingness and if youre paying around 15 for sliders I

they have a bunch of craft beers on tap The food menu is small and consists of apps think chips with salsa queso or guac salads tacos and such but your choices are limited for all of them I went with the recommendation from another review of the queso with everything except chorizo for an app and 2 tacos rojas which were all vegetarian Another disappointment when both arrived at the same time The queso was mediocre at best It was very grainy and the extras of black beans and jalapenos were on top of a cheese crust rather than mixed in the queso The tacos were decent but nothing i would

and jumpy people go for the lines They have actors with chainsaws and creepy makeup pacing around scaring the easy targets posing for pictures and giving you a preview of whats to come The actual haunted house is nothing special If youve been to one before youll see it all again You have actors in creepy makeup and clothing jumping out at you slamming things against the wall or floor and getting up in your face There are rooms youre led through themed as grisly defiled homes kitchens and hallways there was a piratethemed area and a misty jungle to walk through I was disappointed in

everything was something youve seen before but it was beautifully set up 13th Floor may not have scared me but they get points for attention to detail One thing that Ill admit Ive never seen before was the usage of partially closed garage doors placed in strategic areas Open only a foot or two from the floor an actor would get a running start and slide on his knees out from under the door and then pop up next to you The first time or two I saw this it was downright hilarious this does not seem to be an easy or very practiced thing for the actors to do and some of them ate it or slammed into my legs like they were trying to take me out The actors are not supposed toallowed to touch you I will admit that Im not an easy person to scare Im not jumpy or unnerved by the dark loud sounds or people lunging at my face suddenly When you take care of a toddler all day you develop a sort of Clint Eastwood hardness and eventually lose your flinching reflex There were however people all

opened up after me and nobody sat down ugh I wanted waffles though so I ordered the combo which came with pancakes but you could upgrade to a waffle for a buck I also ordered a bloody mary So after I order they come out with chicken and waffles They messed up on my one order so that super sucked The bartender admitted it and asked if I wanted another bloody mary and itd be on her since they messed up but I declined since Id be too blasted walking back to my hotel The bloody mary was really good but the food was just like not good The waffle looked nice and big and fluffy but it was lukewarm and

were sharing the one cocktailwine menu among the table I had to remind the server about my drink order and waited an additional 15 minutes for my glass of wine to arrive We ordered the meat cheese and pickle tray as well as pretzel brioche for appetizers The pretzel brioche and whipped butters were good but no one ever told us what the butters were We figured out one was mustard one honey and the one in the middle was a mystery butter There were very few pickles on our plate one slice of jalapeno for example and we had to ask for more bread In addition I didnt like two of the three cheeses that were served and I cant say that has ever happened to me before Our friends ordered two entrees to share scallops and lamb and the server left before taking the order for the other half of the

but being out of state with no tools and no machine to read the codes to tell me why my car wouldnt start I trusted this place They stated they would have to do diagnostic test and said it would be 59 However the service advisor came back later and said it would be 99 for a full diagnostic test Troubleshooting the problem After a couple hours they called me to the desk and said i would need the following Starter Battery Fuel Pump Fuel Filter Vacuum Line I thought to my self theres no way all those auto parts went bad at the same time on my car They gave me a price of 229 for the battery I told them I can buy it at Advance Auto Parts for 169 So I bought it at Advance and brought it back and put it in myself However I had someone else to check battery and they said all it needed was a slow charge The mechanic said that my starter was fried which the manager agreed was not very professional words used by the mechanic I didnt believe anything was wrong with my starter So I told them to just put the fuel pump fuel filter and vacuum line on and we will see if it will start up afterwards For these 3 parts and labor they gave a price of over 1204 My investigation I called up a neighbor Firestone in Fort Mill and the woman gave a me price of 58487 for the fuel pump fuel filter and labor Why is the price so far apart in difference I questioned the manager about the call I made to Fort Mill Firestone and told him the woman gave me a price of 58487 He said cant be I repeated myself and said I just called them and thats the price she gave me Again he says cant be while shaking his head I felt like he just called me a liar I also called up some other repair shops and they were a lot cheaper too Most prices were in the upper 550 to 590 range including a Firestone in Cleveland Mississippi Another price difference I called up Advance Auto Parts and they gave me a price of 269 for the fuel pump which has the fuel filter with it included Yet this Firestone want to charge me about 450 just for that fuel pump This is not a parts house They buy their parts from places like Advance Autozone and etc then add a markup to that price Final Thoughts Yes I know I helped their profit here big time I trusted them I will never use any Firestone in the Carolinas again I just feel like I was done wrong I didnt need no starter It cranked up fine after they put the fuel

of which they had ONE in the whole store Luckily I came to see just that one I had already looked at it online I show up begin to head inside and am met by a salesperson Sean from Michigan who promptly runs to meet me before I enter the showroom Immediately I inform him of which vehicle I came to look at and he quickly obliges by bringing a golf cart to the front for us to drive to the vehicle We get to the Trailhawk and the sticker price is priced about 2k higher than online I inform Sean of this and he takes a minute to look at the website confirms what I said and lets me know that they would honor the online price The sticker price contradicting the online price was a little off putting What if I hadnt checked online first So we get in the Jeep Sean drives it to the gas station to fill up and lets me know that I am fine to go ahead and get into the drivers seat I move over to the drivers seat Meanwhile he is paying for the gas and as Im sitting there Im looking around checking everything out The first noticeable mishap was a scratch on the interior door I mention it to him and he brushes it off as just residue that will wash off Umm no it was clearly NOT just residue nevermind that I already saw him scratch the tint with the seatbelt buckle As Im looking around more I cant help but think that this 2018 vehicle with 4 miles on it literally looks like it has been used It was dirty and there was trash in the door I guess from a previous test drive It just wasnt presentable at all Sean made sure to mention that it had been on the lot for about a month and that usually cars dont stay on the lot that long Okay sooo why is THIS one still there Then comes the nitty gritty part of car buying the money and the numbers BEFORE I even indicate whether or not I actually want to proceed with the purchase Sean insists that I hurry and fill out the credit application I promptly put things on hold informing him that we needed to talk a liiiittle bit more about the exact details before we go any further After honoring the online price and offering 5k for my trade in I let him know that the offer on the trade in just wont work at all Good thing I did ample research before coming in because I was well aware that EVEN as a trade in my vehicle was worth at least 7k So after a bit of back and forth and him leaving to ask the manager we settle on 6500 Next was time to talk about financing and down payment Luckily they didnt really give me any hassle on wanting to go through my own third party broker for financing but once we started talking about down payment the conversation took a pretty crazy turn I insisted that I wanted to put a down payment to lower the financed amount I let Sean know that I wanted to pay in cash not check of which I would have to go and get He informs me that he doesnt think they can take cash as a down payment So funny because the dealership I ended up buying from let me pay using my debit card same as cash So we went from first putting a down payment to we dont take cash can you write a check to how about you dont put a down payment AT ALL to okay we CAN take cash to why do you have to go and GET the cash cant your boyfriend just bring it to you At this point I realize that this is all going way wrong For one I am in not so many words somewhat being held hostage they have the keys to my trade in of which I had to ask for when I began heading towards the exit Im asked not to leave to get my down payment THEN Sean begins grasping at straws to get me to proceed with filling out the credit app I oblige just to get him to stop hassling me Deciding that Im really not into this particular Trailhawk I ask if theres any way they can keep an eye out on a white one for me instead Sean tells me they CANT keep an eye out for a white one and continues trying everything in his power to get me not to leave even after we discussed that I wanted to go get cash I finally am allowed to leave but only if I promise to be back in 45 minutes nevermind the place I need to go is across town It was about 5pm and he wanted an exact time of how long it would take for me to get the money It was very awkward He informs me that while Im gone theyll go ahead and run my app and I beg them to hold off until I get back Obviously at this point Im NOT coming back Had Sean not been so pushy and not forthcoming regarding the fact that they COULD have looked out for a white Trailhawk for me he later back peddled over text and told me they could make it happen I may have proceeded with my purchase here But I

book because we could have sat anywhere We choose front row in the middle of Dragon I was worried about eating so close to horses but that wasnt a problem at all Sitting in the front made great seats be we were the last to be fed pretty much Id recommend sitting closer to the center and avoid the ends of the arena unless you really want to cheer for a certain country in that area Over all the show

dark like chocolate but pretty dull in flavor The filling was there but not discernable enough to stand out as a flavor unto itself And the ganache was more like dry chocolaty icing IMO not really worth the calories 2 The caramel is a butter cake think yellow filled with caramel mouse and topped with a light caramel frosting The cake was a pretty standard yellow cake The filling was again so mild in flavor that there really wasnt much point in its being there The frosting described as mildly flavored was more of an understatement I really think it was white frosting with a light glazing of caramel underneath IMO really not worth the calories or the price 3The carrot is filled with cream cheese mouse and topped with cream cheese frosting At least this one resembled its description but I wasnt blown away 4 The lemon is a lemon cake filled with lemon chiffon and topped with lemon frosting This was the closest thing to decent in the half dozen that I took home I couldnt detect any lemon in the cake but the filling almost had a hint of tartness and the frosting actually had some zest mixed in which is what I would expect I will definitely support Sweet Thang as a downtown

Mandarin Unfortunately when we went on a Friday night the place was horribly understaffed with only one cook most likely the owner and one waiter And since they serve on a tablebytable process the food for us a party of 8 took almost an hour to completely arrive At least we had tea to keep our stomachs from growling too loudly Once the food arrived I guess I expected more authentic Chinese cooking The beef and chicken was steamed and looked like one of the healthy options you would choose off a separate menu They had a nice variety of Chinese styled vegetables though and a very wide Asian drink selection My regret is that I should have looked at some of the pictures before ordering because some of the dishes were surprisingly simple Such as the shrimp eggs for 10 which was literally a couple of shrimps put inside an egg omelet Im not quite sure how authentic that is The decor was simple There were just a couple of tables for sitdown eating and only two tables that could accommodate large parties of either 6 or 8 It is also BYOB which I didnt discover until another party brought in a couple bottles of wine Im not sure what the corkage fee is though if there is any The

me is why she was left alone No manager to lend a helping hand no server on the floor to take tables It was just all so hard to watch and I felt truly sorry watching her struggle To make matters worse

runny inside Then there was a mixed mess of veggies on the plate which was probably the best thing that I had We also had a blueberry cheesecake thing for dessert Not bad but not overly impressive Its like a nobake cheesecake in a graham cracker pie shell Im sure their ingredients were fresher but about anyone could do something similar in their kitchen in a short amount of time Though I didnt have

dont have to watch ppl walking up and down right next to your food But after we were sitted no one ever came by or gave us water or anything while the tables next to us got water refilled at least twice no one came serve us and we literally just sat there for 15 mins with thirsty mouth Finally I have to grab a waitress that was walking by and ask her at least get us a cup of water I think we just got missed while switching tables and they dont know who should be serving us and we finally got our waitress whom is super amazing and has a lot of good reccomendation The food portion is super small more like tapa even though they priced at entree price We ended up ordering a lot Food is good but the portion dont really worth the price you paid if you come with empty stomach then you better

asked for it which was really weird why they wouldnt give me straight vinegar at a Filipino joint Their style of cooking is less tangy than I cook and a bit sweet Lechon Kawali this was good lechon nice melty fat but was deep fried so some bits were too crispy since it wasnt roasted Pompano on the grill decent the fish tasted fresh Pancit this was passable Ampalaya It had eggs and ground meat and tomato Pretty decent but I cant eat a lot since Im not a huge fan of ampalaya on its own Sisig normally this is the favorite and what goes fast but it was one of the items left because it wasnt that great It was missing flavor I added some of that soyvinegarsugar dip they kept giving me instead of vinegar to try to help it I dont know why my family got halo halo and turon seeing as it took so long to eat but the turon with ube ice cream was pretty nicely done I did not try the halo halo but they didnt have flan and as much variety of toppings on it My nephew got a sago and gulaman and said it was way too sweet A kid who naturally loves sugary junk had to pour water into it Service was meh Like I said the kitchen took a long time The front of staff were just okay We didnt get plates for a while and then didnt get water until 2030 minutes after being seated Plates after eating and waiting for desserts werent cleared and we had to tell them we want to take home leftovers then were given ill suited boxes for them too large and one thing was really soupy for a clamshell container We had to ask for the check We had to flag for items we need The service just felt very pre occupied
